### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andrei Soroka.

I've been developing since 2012, taking on roles across the spectrum in tech: from backend and frontend development
(with a focus on the latter) to DevOps, Product Ownership, Team Leadership, and Technical Leadership.

>
> I'm open to discussing test assignments under the following conditions:
>
> 1. Your Company Is Exceptional - Let's talk more about it and make a short call before ðŸ˜„
> 2. The Task Is Unique, Not Routine - I appreciate challenges that are out of the ordinary. While I'm capable of
     working in various styles and patterns (you can check my GitHub for examples), I'm not interested in standard
     business logic tasks.
> 3. Opportunity for New Experiences - I'm all for trying new things. If it's something I haven't done before, like
     working with a new technology or framework, I'm interested. However, I'd prefer to avoid revisiting familiar
     ground.
> 4. Short Assignments Only - I'm willing to consider brief tasks that won't take up too much of my time.
> 5. Public Sharing of the Assignment - I reserve the right to publish the assignment and its outcomes because it
     involves my time.
>
> > **Question**: Points 3 and 4 imply that you won't be able to fully showcase your best code, is that right?
> >
> > **Answer**: Any "best" code you have becomes outdated within a couple of months.
> > And what is the best code without code review and team collaboration?
>
> Please don't misunderstand me. I'm not trying to be difficult. I'm just trying to be honest and transparent.
>
> Let's connect and discuss how we can collaborate!
>
> Best,
> Andrei Soroka

### 2023:

Fun fact: In 2023, I completed a couple of test assignments in different styles.
For the first one, I quickly put something together, but
for the second, I aimed to craft what I considered the best code for that year.

> I decided
> to [log](https://github.com/AndreiSoroka/chat-app-react-node/blob/main/doc/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md) my process of
> development. Just read it before you start judging me. ðŸ˜„
>
> Unlike the previous task, I just started doing it, without thinking through the work.

> In this task, I wanted to show how the development and testing process can be automated. I went a bit overhead and
> just enjoyed it :)
> Aside from the fact that the last time I worked with React was in 2018 (and even then, infrequently, and now it's
> 2023).
>
> I also decided to try out [FSD](https://feature-sliced.design/). It took me a while to really appreciate it,
> especially after finishing this task.
>
> P.s. I understood [FSD](https://feature-sliced.design/) only after a few more projects, but not here.

I don't remember when it was...

#### Concentration game

- Code: https://github.com/AndreiSoroka/concentration-game
- Demo: https://concentration-game.andreisoroka.com/
- Stack: Vue2, Webpack
- Description: A game where you need to flip cards and find matching pairs.

> It was just a fun task. Nothing special.

#### 15 puzzle game

- Code: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AndreiSoroka/15-puzzle-game)
- Demo (2 hours, branch master): [15-puzzle-game](https://15-puzzle-game.andreisoroka.com/)
- Demo (3 hours, branch redux): [15-puzzle-game-redux](https://15-puzzle-game-redux.andreisoroka.com/)
- Stack: React, Webpack
- Description: A classic 15-puzzle sliding game, implemented in React. The game involves moving tiles in a grid to
  organize them in order, with one tile missing.

> This task was unique as I had a time constraint: of 3 hours. And I'm not primarily a React developer. So, with the
> documentation by my side, I demonstrated my ability to work with it.

#### Crypto-currency calculator

- Code: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AndreiSoroka/openexchangerates-calculator)
- Demo: [openexchangerates-calculator](https://openexchangerates-calculator.andreisoroka.com/)
- Stack: Vue2, Vuex, Webpack
- Description: A compact app that allows for the comparison of cryptocurrency prices.

> The task specified that the calculations should be error-free. The catch, which one could easily miss, was that for
> Bitcoin, you need to use 8 digits after the decimal. Try executing `console.log(0.3 - 0.1)` in the browser, and you'll
> understand.

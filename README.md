### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andrei Soroka.

I've decided to gather my test tasks all in one place:

____
### 2023:

#### Chat (Work In Progress)
- Code: https://github.com/AndreiSoroka/chat-app-react-node
- Stack: Node.js, React, MobX
- Development log: https://github.com/AndreiSoroka/chat-app-react-node/blob/main/doc/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md
> **Not finished**. But I made the decision to [log](https://github.com/AndreiSoroka/chat-app-react-node/blob/main/doc/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md) my process of development.
> Unlike the previous task, I just started doing it, without thinking through the work.

#### Cart component
- Code: https://github.com/AndreiSoroka/cart-component/tree/master
- Demo: https://cart-component.andreisoroka.com/
- Test coverage: https://cart-component.andreisoroka.com/coverage/
- Playwright report: https://cart-component.andreisoroka.com/playwright-report/
- Storybook: https://cart-component.andreisoroka.com/storybook/
- Description: A simple shopping cart component.
- Stack: React, TypeScript, Redux, SCSS, Jest, Playwright, Storybook, Vite, Docker, Eslint, Stylelint, Prettier
 > In this task, I wanted to show how the development and testing process can be automated. I went a bit overhead and just enjoyed it :)
> Aside from the fact that the last time I worked with React was in 2018 (and even then, infrequently, and now it's 2023).
>
> I also decided to try out [FSD](https://feature-sliced.design/). It took me a while to really appreciate it, especially after finishing this task.

### 2019:
#### Weather History Canvas
- Code: https://github.com/AndreiSoroka/weather-history-canvas
- Demo: https://weather-history-canvas.andreisoroka.com/
- Description: A client application for visualizing data from a web service, which archives temperature changes and precipitation levels over the last 120 years in one of the cities of ***.
- Stack: HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript without the use of third-party libraries and tools.
> This was an interesting task since I wasn't allowed to use any libraries.

____
### 2018:
#### Concentration game
- Code: https://github.com/AndreiSoroka/concentration-game
- Demo: https://concentration-game.andreisoroka.com/
- Stack: Vue2, Webpack
- Description: A game where you need to flip cards and find matching pairs.
> It was just a fun task. Nothing special.

#### 15 puzzle game
- Code: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AndreiSoroka/15-puzzle-game)
- Demo (2 hours, branch master): [15-puzzle-game](https://15-puzzle-game.andreisoroka.com/)
- Demo (3 hours, branch redux): [15-puzzle-game-redux](https://15-puzzle-game-redux.andreisoroka.com/)
- Stack: React, Webpack
- Description: A classic 15-puzzle sliding game, implemented in React. The game involves moving tiles in a grid to organize them in order, with one tile missing.
> This task was unique as I had a time constraint: 3 hours. And I'm not primarily a React developer. So, with the documentation by my side, I demonstrated my ability to work with it.

#### Crypto-currency calculator
- Code: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AndreiSoroka/openexchangerates-calculator)
- Demo: [openexchangerates-calculator](https://openexchangerates-calculator.andreisoroka.com/)
- Stack: Vue2, Vuex, Webpack
- Description: A compact app that allows for the comparison of cryptocurrency prices.
> The task specified that the calculations should be error-free. The catch, which one could easily miss, was that for Bitcoin, you need to use 8 digits after the decimal. Try executing `console.log(0.3 - 0.1)` in the browser, and you'll understand.
